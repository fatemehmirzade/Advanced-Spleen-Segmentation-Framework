# Unet-model-for-spleen-segmentation

This study focuses on the utilization of ultrasound imaging data obtained from patients' spleens, with the primary objective of employing computational algorithms for segmentation, identification, and precise localization of the spleen regions within the images. Such delineation facilitates subsequent quantitative assessments, notably the estimation of spleen dimensions, thereby potentially serving as an adjunctive diagnostic tool for discerning pathologic conditions such as infection.

The Unet network architecture was selected as the primary computational framework for this segmentation task due to its recognized efficacy in medical image analysis, particularly in scenarios necessitating high-fidelity delineation of anatomical structures. Noteworthy, the Unet architecture comprises an encoder-decoder paradigm augmented with skip connections, enabling the model to effectively capture both global context and fine-grained details within the images.

Empirical evaluation of the implemented Unet model demonstrates favorable performance characteristics, as evidenced by attained metrics. Specifically, examination of model performance on a distinct test dataset reveals a commendable accuracy metric of 0.91, indicative of the model's proficiency in accurately segmenting spleen regions within ultrasound images. Such outcomes underscore the utility and efficacy of the Unet network architecture in the context of medical image segmentation tasks, thereby affirming its suitability for the present application.
